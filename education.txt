the best care for all patients, regardless of cultural or linguistic background.

Any direct service provider interested in learning about culturally and linguistically appropriate services

patient-centered care.
Course 2 covers communication and language assistance, including how to work effectively with an interpreter.
Course 3 covers organizational CLAS-related activities, including strategic planning, staff training, and community partnerships.
